# Why Peer Review is Toxic:<br> A guide for aspiring scientists

The ritual of peer review has such a sacred role in science that we, like members of religions and cults, blind ourselves its harms and its dissonance with our values.

<!-- Like religions and cults, science has a ritual so sacred to us that we blind ourselves to its harms and its dissonance with our values: peer review. -->

The scientific ideal of peer review is that of a process designed to protect the objectivity and accuracy of research. We invite disinterested parties to scrutinize our research no matter how expert we are in designing, conducting, and presenting it because they provide objectivity. They are less likely to overlook mistakes that we may subconsciously ignore in our own work or in collaborative work with those we admire, and are not subject to the group think that can evolve among collaborators.

<!-- Outside perspectives are also important , our mere our choice to use a particular experimental design is itself bayesian evidence for suspicion--for any flawed research design, only those incapable of seeing the design's flaws will use it unwittingly. -->

The scientific ideal of peer review has been lost because we almost always perform it within a system of social stratification. In this system, peer review is conducted by conferences and journals, each with has its own brand, tier of prestige, and expectations for whether a research paper is worthy of the publication's brand prestige. We do not just expect that research should not mislead, but apply subjective goals such as "novelty," "importance", and the particularly ephemeral "significance of contribution." We rank research by the desirability of the conference and journal that published it; we distribute prestige to researchers by their ability to accumulate prestige via these publications; we distribute jobs based on this prestige.

To anyone not blinded through membership in our cult, it seems obvious that a process employed for social stratification cannot help but become toxic.
But, to deprogram my fellow scientists, and to help inoculate aspiring scientists, I will detail the inevitable consequences of this choice that we who perpetuate this system are complicit in.
I will then debunk the common argument that we have no choice but to conduct peer review in this way for lack of better alternatives, so that we can begin to remove this cancer on science itself.

<!-- Our perversion of peer review has made it less objective and is a cancer on science itself. It is time to open our eyes to the harms of this avoidable choice and our complicity in perpetuating these systems in the presence of alternatives. -->

### Problems

Discourages null results and replications resulting in survivor bias.
The most unexpected results are the most interesting, but also those we should be most suspicious of.
An idea may appear novel simply because others who have thought of it discarded it for good reason.


#### Increases subjectivity

##### Gatekeeping

#### Disincentivizes integrity

#### Slows science

#### Decreases diversity of contribution types

#### Unnecessary work
Citations, revisions, conforming to expectations


### How to separate

Curation will always be subjective, but learning that others are less interested in the questions you are investigating is less harmful than being rejected from a process with the implication that you have failed in other ways.

"Curation" is easy to add later. Journals that invite reviewed papers.  Conferences that distribute presentation space based on interest.

Liberates us to put review before running studies.

<!-- It will be impossible to participate in reviewing scientific work without being complicit in the mental health harms to scientists, and would-be scientists, of social stratification. -->


<!-- Sadly, this makes it impossible to participate in a process supposedly key to scientific objectivity without becoming complicit in the mental health harms to scientists and would-be scientists .  -->

<!-- The zero-sum game of distributing prestige is toxic to scientific objectivity and to the mental health of scientists and would-be scientists. When integrated into  and is a cancer on science itself.  Cue the offspring. -->

### Why status ranking is inherently toxic

To make a publication selective, conferences and journals must determine whether research papers constitute a "significant contribution" worthy of the status of being associated with their brand.

The ambiguity in what "contribution" even means opens the floodgates of subjectivity, giving reviewers a blank check to reject work because they weren't sufficiently convinced it was important, or because it didn't cite work that they thought was worth mentioning, or because the way was organized in a way that they wouldn't have organized it. Anyone self-confident enough to believe that they could have done a better job of designing, conducting, or presenting the research can reject you for not doing what they would have done.

<!-- Destroy trust in the review process -->

When authors submit to a review process that uses subjective metrics, rather than scientific objectivity, they will optimize for those metrics. This reduced integrity, as some authors will try to inflate their importance of their findings or outright cheat. It also wastes a lot of time, as authors will take a paper that only builds on five or ten other prior papers worth citing, but will then add 50 or 100 citations so as not to have a below-average citation count and to ensure they don't risk citing work by potential reviewers who might fault the paper for not being deferential to their past contributions. Writing papers defensively in anticipation of subjective reviewing can be exhausting, especially when one failure to appease a reviewer's ego can set your publication date back by months or years.

But the real cost is to mental health.





<!-- As a member of a peer review committee, can dismiss a paper by arguing that authors should do a better job justifying the importance of the question they are investigating, or because the authors weren't sufficiently deferential to prior research, or because they didn't structure to put sections an order that reviewers prefer. -->

### Curation





### Consequences

As such, peer review committees have become the battle grounds in which the senior members of research communities argue over what ideas and directions are "important" and worthy of presentation. New initiates to our scientific endeavor are often collateral damage, especially those without powerful allies and those brave enough to pioneer work in areas that others have yet to grasp the importance of.


### Consequences

Biases participation against those who put up with these consequences.

#### Wasted time

New researchers quickly discover that time they thought they would be dedicating to running experiments and learning new things is, in fact, dedicated to rewording their findings so as not to offend or unnerve.
It's bad for reviewers too!

#### Delayed results
#### Mental health

A 20% accept rate means 80% of participants are being told they're not good enough.

#### Biasing participation to exclude

As a new graduate student, learning to recognize the abusiveness of this practice is key to surviving it and, hopefully, refusing to join those who accept as necessary (or at least inevitable).

You don't have the least power, and the system is designed to protect those with power over you.
Those who have power 
Your paper may be rejected because reviewers who compete with your advisor don't like the topic your advisors suggested you work on, or because you failed to cite their work, or because they didn't like.  . 

# Why is peer review abusive

Evaluate science to ensure that results don't mislead. (Both )

Determine whether research is novel, interesting, or otherwise significant enough to warrant publication at the venue it is being evaluated for.

<!-- Ranking the subjective value of creative work, and those who create it, is incompatible with the scientific process. -->

# It's not okay

Everyone thinks that the review process is random and that feedback is often unconstructive, and often abusive.  Everyone seems to have stories of reviewers who didn't read papers, who intentionally kept competing work out, or who rejected work because the reviewers' favorite work (often their own) wasn't cited.
Reviewer 2 memes.

Yet, nobody thinks they or their are that reviewer, even though many of us frequently confess to delaying reviews until the last minute when we have no choice but to rush them.  The number of peers we think of as abusive or careless and the number of abusive and careless reviews are inconsistent.

Our continued faith in the ritual of peer ritual, despite all the evidence we see as we and our students suffer its abuses, can feel cultish to the new initiate to our tribe.  The best time to prepare for this reality is now, before you establish your loyalty to the tribe, so that you can recognize how abusive it is and resolve not to carry that abuse forward.

# Biases participation in science

You have to be "thick skinned" enough to survive as a scientist despite this abusive process.
You have to be okay with participating in, and thus being complicit in the process.
Values protecting the anonymity of people with more power than you (reviewers) over your mental health.  (Anonymity is designed to protect junior faculty, but students can only aspire to have the power of those who get to subjectively evaluate the importance of their work anonymously and without consequences for errors.)


# 

# Compromises scientific integrity

# Delays the release of information


# Alternatives

Split these two purposes.

Even better, evaluate experiments before they are conducted!
